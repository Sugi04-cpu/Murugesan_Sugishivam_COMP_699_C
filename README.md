## 1. Prerequisites

- **Python 3.8+**
- **MongoDB** (local or Atlas cluster)
- **pip** (Python package manager)
- **Git** (for cloning the repository)

---

## 2. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Sugi04-cpu/Murugesan_Sugishivam_COMP_699_C
cd Murugesan_Sugishivam_COMP_699_C
```

---

## 3. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```sh
python -m venv env
# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source env/bin/activate
```

---

## 4. Install Dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## 5. Configure MongoDB

- Ensure MongoDB is running locally (`mongodb://localhost:27017/`) or use a MongoDB Atlas URI.
- Update your Django settings or environment variables with your MongoDB connection string and database name, for example:
    ```python
    MONGO_URI = "mongodb://localhost:27017/"
    MONGO_DB_NAME = "e_commerce_db"
    ```
- No need to run `python manage.py migrate` as Django ORM is not used for MongoDB.

---

## 6. (Optional) Create a Superuser

If you want to use Django’s admin panel for other purposes:
```sh
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
> Note: The admin panel is not used for MongoDB data, but you can still use it for Django’s built-in apps.

---

## 7. Run the Development Server

```sh
python manage.py runserver
```
Visit [http://127.0.0.1:8000/](http://127.0.0.1:8000/) in your browser.
